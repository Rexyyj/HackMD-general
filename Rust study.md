# Rust Study

## Common programming concepts
1. By default variables are immutable.
2. Shadowing:declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. 
3. Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. 
4. Number literals can also use _ as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as 1_000, which will have the same value as if you had specified 1000
